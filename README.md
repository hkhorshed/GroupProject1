# Pillow Realty Website

## Incorprating API into a Front End Project

## Introduction 
This website is structured on four different API's working in parallel. The scope of this website is to provide an easy process in finding out about median house prices, school information, and social events that take place in the city 
one wishes to move to.

## Description
First, The user may access the tables under the table dropdown part of the navigation bar. The user can then filter all based on city or school name depending on the table they wish to use.
The schools table has each school hyperlinked to the school website if furthen information is needed.

After that, one can access the map page to see visually what they are looking for. Entering a city and state on the map page will zoom in on that location selected with house and school markers present.
Each marker contains some basic information about the house or school.
